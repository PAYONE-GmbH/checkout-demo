# PAYONE checkout demo app

This demo app shows example [use cases](#use-cases-overview) for an online-payment and serves as a demonstration of PAYONE's API usage and its concepts.
The app shows a usage scenario for an e-shop that allows card, PayPal, and Paydirekt payment methods.

## Use cases overview
1. [Pay via a card (with/without 3DSecure)](#pay-via-a-card-without-3dsecure)
2. [Pay via PayPal and Paydirekt](#pay-via-paydirekt)
3. [Receive an example transaction status notification from the PAYONE system](#receive-example-transaction-status-notification)

## How to read the Readme?
As for how to read this README for the first time, we recommend to
- first, check out ["Use cases' showcase" section](#use-cases-showcase)
- (then you can install the app to be able to play around with it yourself - follow section ["Installation"](#installation))
- secondly, read ["Let's do it" section](/_docs/detailed-readme.md#lets-do-it) in the more detailed doc - [Detailed Readme](/_docs/detailed-readme.md)
- and then, read ["Internals" section](/_docs/detailed-readme.md#internals) in the [more detailed Readme](/_docs/detailed-readme.md)

[Detailed Readme](/_docs/detailed-readme.md) elaborates more on tech details and PAYONE's API concepts.  
So, most probably, you _would_ want to check it out. The link to it, again: [the detailed Readme](/_docs/detailed-readme.md).

4. `php -S localhost:3000` to run the PHP built-in server
5. Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser ðŸ™‚

Prerequisites for the demo app to run are:
